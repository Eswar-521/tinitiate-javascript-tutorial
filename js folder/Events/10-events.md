## Events in JavaScript

### Definition:

- Events in JavaScript are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, often triggered by the user or the browser itself.

ðŸ‘‰ Examples:

- A user clicks a button

- A user presses a key

- A web page loads completely

- A mouse moves over an element

* JavaScript can react to these events using event handlers.

### Example : Button Click Event

```ts

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Event Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Click Me</button>

<script>
  function myFunction() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation : 

- `<button onclick="myFunction()">` â†’ The event is onclick (triggered when button is clicked).

- `myFunction()` â†’ The function that runs when the event occurs.

- `alert("Button clicked!")` â†’ Action that happens when button is clicked.
